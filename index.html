        This isn't the typical EMS job.  I'm a paramedic, but I don't have an ambulance.  I'm on call for weeks at a time and I don't have any backup.  I have boatloads of drugs that most paramedics have never even heard of.  My largest patient weighed almost 1300 pounds, and he was a bull moose.  We do weird stuff out here.  I've worked everything from ice roads to weapons abatement sites to fishing vessels to ore mines, and I can't believe I've gotten to do this for five years.<br><br>This site is going to serve as a dumping ground for all the weird and wonderful stuff I've seen over the years. You'll see a lot of abbreviations and references to generic locations because I'm not allowed to talk about most of my job sites, but I'm not going to protect anything I don't absolutely have to.  I love Alaska but my employers and their clients don't deserve protection and I do still need a job for the next few months.
